## Fast Track Release Plan

### ✅ COMPLETED: 8.0.0-beta.5: Options Ecosystem (DONE!)
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All tasks finished ahead of schedule!

#### ✅ Completed Implementation Tasks:
- ✅ **Created `IAlpacaOptionsStreamingClient` interface** - Done!
- ✅ **Implemented AlpacaOptionsStreamingClient class** - Done!
- ✅ **Added Environment factory method** - Done!
- ✅ **Integration tests and documentation** - Done!
- ✅ **Added Latest Option Bars endpoint** - Done!
- ✅ **Added Historical Option Quotes endpoint** - Done!

**Client Impact:** 🔥 **MASSIVE** - Options trading ecosystem is now complete!

---

### 🎯 NEXT UP: 8.0.0-beta.5 → Order Imbalance Streaming
**Priority:** HIGH - Next critical feature for advanced traders
**Effort:** 3-4 days | **Risk:** Low-Medium

**Rationale:** With options ecosystem complete, order imbalance data is the next most valuable feature for sophisticated trading strategies.

#### Implementation Tasks for Order Imbalance Streaming (Issue #770):
- [ ] **Add order imbalance subscription to `IAlpacaDataStreamingClient`**
  ```csharp
  IAlpacaDataSubscription<IOrderImbalance> GetOrderImbalanceSubscription(String symbol);
  ```
- [ ] **Create `IOrderImbalance` interface and implementation**
  - Fields: Symbol, Timestamp, ReferencePrice, PairedShares, ImbalanceShares, ImbalanceSide, etc.
- [ ] **WebSocket channel: "imbalances"**
- [ ] **Add JSON deserialization support**
- [ ] **Integration tests and documentation**

**Reference:** Go SDK implementation available for guidance
**Client Impact:** 🔥 **HIGH** - Enables sophisticated pre-market/close trading strategies

---

### 🔧 8.0.0-rc.1: Crypto Perpetuals & Polish (Week 3-4)
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Clarify existing features
**Effort:** 4-5 days | **Risk:** Low

#### 1. Crypto Perpetual Futures Clarification (Issue #772)
- [ ] **Test existing crypto clients with perpetual symbols**
  - Verify if `IAlpacaCryptoDataClient` already handles perpetuals
  - Test with actual perpetual symbols (e.g., `BTCUSD-PERP`)

- [ ] **Based on testing results:**
  - **Option A:** Document existing support if it works
  - **Option B:** Enhance crypto clients for explicit perpetual support
  - **Option C:** Create separate perpetual client (only if absolutely necessary)

#### 2. Documentation & Polish
- [ ] **Update XML documentation** (Quick wins from Issue #387)
- [ ] **Add usage examples** for new streaming clients
- [ ] **Performance testing** and optimizations
- [ ] **Final integration testing**

**Client Impact:** ⚡ **MEDIUM** - Clarifies existing functionality

---

### 🎯 8.0.0 Final Release (Week 4)
**Priority:** SHIP IT
**Effort:** 2 days | **Risk:** Low

- [ ] **Final testing and validation**
- [ ] **Release notes and migration guide**
- [ ] **NuGet package publication**
- [ ] **Documentation updates**

---

## What We're NOT Doing (Defer to 8.1 or 9.0)

### ❌ Major Architectural Changes (Too risky for fast delivery):
- JSON library migration (Issue #145) - Major breaking change
- C# records conversion (Issue #355) - Extensive refactoring
- Code deduplication (Issue #406) - Internal architecture work
- Enhanced market screening - Nice-to-have vs critical features

### ❌ Documentation-Only Items (Can be done post-8.0):
- Issue #387 (XML comments) - Some quick fixes in RC, rest later
- Issue #388 (code examples) - Can be added incrementally
- Issue #23 (tutorial) - Documentation work

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### 🔴 High Risk: Options Streaming Implementation
- **Risk:** MessagePack complexity, WebSocket stability, new streaming protocol
- **Mitigation:**
  - Leverage existing MessagePack infrastructure
  - Follow proven patterns from existing streaming clients
  - Thorough testing with sandbox environment
  - Feature flag for gradual rollout

### 🟡 Medium Risk: API Endpoint Additions
- **Risk:** REST API changes, request/response model complexity
- **Mitigation:**
  - Follow established patterns from existing endpoints
  - Comprehensive testing with actual API endpoints
  - Incremental implementation and testing

### 🟢 Low Risk: Documentation and Polish
- **Risk:** Time pressure might skip documentation
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prioritize critical documentation only
  - Use automated documentation generation where possible
